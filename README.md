#   BUILD A TRIBUTE PAGE


##  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/).

#   RULES
1.  Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2.  Fulfill the below user stories: 
    - Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
    - I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
    - I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
    
### NOTE: You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
