                        <p class="early_years_body">Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930, to the family of  Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, both of which were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society (CMS) in Nigeria.</p>
                
                        <p class="early_years_body"> Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam Achebe stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence; this made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinualumogu. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to Isaiah Achebe's ancestral town of Ogidi, in what is now the state of Anambra Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                        <p class="career_body">In 1948, in preparation for independence, Nigeria's first university opened Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan). Achebe was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine.
                        It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After graduation Achebe returned to his hometown of Ogidi after his final examination at Ibadan in 1953.</p>
                        <p class="career_body">He was visited by his friend, from the university, who convinced him to apply for an English teaching position at the Merchants of Light school at Oba. He worked there four (4) months. He left in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), he left the school and moved to... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>

                        <p class="family_body">In the same year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.</p>
                        <p class="family_body">Their first child, a daughter named Chinelo, was born on 11 July 1962.

He devoted more time to editing Okike and became active with the left-leaning People's Redemption Party (PRP). In 1983, he became the party's deputy national vice-president. He published a book called The Trouble with Nigeria to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says bluntly: "the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership.</p>

In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman's Library collection published by Alfred A. Knopf. His 60th birthday was celebrated at the University of Nigeria by "an international Who's Who in African Literature". One observer noted: "Nothing like it had ever happened before in African literature anywhere on the continent.</p>
                
                        <p class="legacy_body">Achebe provided a "blueprint" for African writers of succeeding generations. In 1982, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Kent.
